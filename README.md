# JPGtoASCII
Convert a JPG image file to ASCII format stored inside of a txt file.

### How to Convert
Place a JPG image file in the same file location as the src.py file, and rename it to "miku.jpg." (You can also edit the code yourself to change the image it converts).
Run the src.py file and it'll create an "ascii.txt" file in the same location containing the result.

### Installation
This uses the Pillow (PIL) Python library to read the image file. You can install it by running 
```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow
```
in a command prompt window.
